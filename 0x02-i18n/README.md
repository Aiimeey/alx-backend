Project Description: Internationalization (i18n) with Flask and Babel

This repository contains a series of Flask applications designed to demonstrate internationalization (i18n) using the Flask-Babel extension. Each task progressively builds upon the previous one, culminating in a fully internationalized web application.
Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

    Task 0: Basic setup of a Flask app with a simple route and template.
    Task 1: Integration of Flask-Babel extension and configuration of supported languages.
    Task 2: Implementation of language selection based on user preferences and request headers.
    Task 3: Localization of templates using message parametrization and translation files.
    Task 4: Introduction of URL parameter to force a specific language locale.
    Task 5: Mocking user login to demonstrate personalized language and timezone settings.
    Task 6: Enhancement of language selection using user preferences if available.
    Task 7: Implementation of timezone selection based on URL parameters and user settings.
    Task 8 (Advanced): Displaying current time based on the inferred timezone.

Requirements

    Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
    Installation of Flask-Babel 2.0.0
    Compliance with PEP 8 style guidelines (pycodestyle)
    Comprehensive documentation for all code components
    Type annotations for all functions and methods

Additional Notes

    Each task builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and features related to internationalization and localization.
    The project emphasizes proper setup of Flask-Babel, handling of language preferences, and dynamic content localization.
    For advanced tasks, additional functionalities such as user login simulation and timezone handling are implemented to enhance user experience.
